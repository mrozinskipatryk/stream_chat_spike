# README

- Created with ruby 3.2.0 and Rails 7.0.4.1

run:

- bundle install
- rails db:seed (creates 3 users, I didn't bother with password, so you need just user name.)

- create .env file (example: .env_example)
  - replace variables (you can create 30 days free trial on getstream.io or ping me, my trial might still work)
